//Within the class, ShowPowerRange create a static method PowerRanger() that takes in integer degree, start, finish. 

//The method returns all the numbers from the range [start, finish] (inclusive and finish > 0 and start > 0) that are equal to the degree-th power of any positive integer.

//In the case start > finish, or start < 0, or finish < 0 the method returns 0.

//The method involves yielding the intermediate result on each iteration.


//For example, when calling the method PowerRanger():
//for (int item in PowerRanger(3, 1, 200))
//{
//    Console.WriteLine("{0} ", item);
//}

//Output:
//1
//8
//64
//125
