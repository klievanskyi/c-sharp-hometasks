//Please, implement EvaluateAggregate method that takes 

//     an array of doubles as the first parameter,

//     a delegate that defines an aggregate behavior as the second,

//     a delegate that defines a condition for the index as the third parameter.

//The method should return a result of an aggregate operation for the elements with indexes that satisfy the condition set by the third parameter

//(You don't need to verify on null parameter values. Assume that parameters will always be not null)
