//Please, create class DisposePatternImplementer that implements Disposable pattern and inherits from CloseableResource class

//Print such lines of information in the method responsible for releasing managed and unmanaged resources:

//"Disposing by developer" if the object of the class is disposed by developer

//or "Disposing by GC" if the object is disposed by garbage collector

//also, you should ensure that method Close() is called in either case.
